        It is thought that <em>cats</em> were originally domesticated because
        they hunted mice that would eat stored grains, but a recent study found
        that <em>cats </em>domesticated themselves. They were never specifically
        sought out for domestication like dogs were but their coexistence with
        humans naturally developed from the mutually beneficial nature of the
        relationship, with their hunting protecting the food stores. It was a
        beneficial situation for both species: <strong>cats got </strong> a
        reliable source of prey, and humans got effortless pest control. This
        mutually beneficial arrangement began the relationship between
        <span class="class1">cats and humans </span> which continues to this
        day.
